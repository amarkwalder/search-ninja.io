# Welcome to Search Ninja - The AI based search and index platform

Search Ninja is a platform on which documents from various sources are automatically indexed.

The indexes are categorized by means of artificial intelligence and store them as metadata to the document in the index.

The intelligent search is based on these categories as well as on a full text search.

The processed documents are stored at a defined location in the source based on the year and month of creation. The index is updated when changes are made to already processed documents.
